# redeploy
A lightweight, self-hosted Docker tool to deploy Git-hosted sites locally. Clone, build, and deploy Hugo, Go, or Node.js sites with custom commands, branch selection, and private repo access. Detect changes and auto-redeploy â€” a flexible alternative to SaaS tools like Cloudflare Pages or GitHub Pages.
